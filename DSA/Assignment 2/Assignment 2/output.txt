Test 1: initialization and update
Test 2: Add some more records (more than expected)
Test 3: Checking hashtableTable::find() and that records were properly recorded...
Test 4: Change some records in hashtable table and see if it still works
Test 5: Checking hashtable::find() and whether or not records were properly updated...
Test 6: Create a table using copy constructor
Test 7: Remove some records that exist from hashtable table...
Test 8: Check that removed records are gone and other are unaffected in hashtable table...
Test 9: Attempt to remove some records that do not exist from the table
Test 10: Checking hashtableCopy to see that it was unaffected by removing from hashtable
Test 11: Test assignment operator
Test 12: Add the removed items back to hashtable table...
Test 13: Checking that everything in hashtable was properly updated adding adding removed records back
13 out of 13 tests passed.
Congratulations, looks like your assignment is completed
